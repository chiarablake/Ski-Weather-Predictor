# Ski Weather Predictor

Final Project for DS4400:
Utilizing historical weather data, we explored the capabilities of machine learning models to predict snow depth at popular ski resorts across the United States. We accessed API’s and performed random forest regressions, feature importance, multiple and polynomial regression models, and methods of cross-validation to investigate this problem.
